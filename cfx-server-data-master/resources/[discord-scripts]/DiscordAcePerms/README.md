### Version 1.0

#### Installation Information:

This is another one of my discord scripts! :) If used properly along with my other scripts, you can fully make your server use only discord roles for permissions and chat roles ;)

You must set up IllusiveTeaâ€™s discord_perms script for this to work properly:

The permissions for a user update after every restart when they first login (so long as they have the discord role ID associated with the group in the list).

#### How to set it up:


The 1s should be replaced with IDs of the respective roles in your discord server. The quotes with groups should represent the groups in your permissions.cfg or server.cfg.
```lua
roleList = {
{1, "group.tc"}, --[[ Trusted-Civ --- ]] 
{1, "group.faa"}, --[[ FAA --- ]]
{1, "group.donator"}, --[[ Donator --- ]]
{1, "group.trialModerator"}, --[[ T-Mod --- ]] 
{1, "group.moderator"}, --[[ Moderator --- ]]
{1, "group.admin"}, --[[ Admin --- ]]
{1, "group.admin"}, --[[ Management --- ]]
{1, "group.owner"}, --[[ Owner --- ]]
}
